# Introduction
Transformer-Based Conditioned Variational Autoencoder (T-CVAE) for Paraphrase Generation. T-CVAE was originally proposed for story completion task in IJCAI'19 paper: *T-CVAE: Transformer-Based Conditioned Variational Autoencoder for Story Completion* by Wang, Tianming and Wan, Xiaojun. The implementation is based on [@sodawater](https://github.com/sodawater)'s [T-CVAE](https://github.com/sodawater/T-CVAE).
